This module adds print control functionality to document pages based on tags. It allows users to control which document pages cannot be printed by configuring tags with a "Not Printable" attribute.

When a document page has one or more tags marked as not printable, printing functionality will be disabled and a warning will be shown if attempted.

Users with the "Manager" role in the "Document Knowledge" section (under Settings > Users > Access Rights > Other) are exempt from these restrictions and can print any document page regardless of its tags.
