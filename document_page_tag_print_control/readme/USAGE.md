To restrict the printing of document pages using tags:

1. Go to Document Management > Configuration > Tags.
2. Create or edit existing tags and use the "Not Printable" checkbox to prevent printing.
3. Check "Not Printable" for tags that should block printing.
4. Assign these tags to document pages. If any tag on a page is marked as not printable, the entire page will be blocked from printing.
5. If you attempt to print such pages, the system will raise a warning and prevent the action.
6. All tags allow printing by default for compatibility.

Users with the **Manager** role in the "Document Knowledge" section (Settings > Users > Access Rights > Other) are not affected by this restriction. They can always print any document page.
